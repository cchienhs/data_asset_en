EnOS Time Series Database (TSDB) provides efficient and stable storage and management for time series data that is ingested from devices or generated by the stream processing engine. EnOS TSDB can not only store massive time series data, but also support fast query of the store data for data visualization. You can store your business data by categories (data types and storage time) based your data storage and data reading requirements, thus reducing data storage costs and enhancing data reading efficiency. 

With the Data Insights feature, you can view the latest data ingested from your devices and also generate a chart for time series data stored in TSDB by selecting a specific time range and device measuring points.

With the Data Cleanup feature, you can delete the historical data stored in TSDB, thus releasing storage resource and saving data storage costs.
